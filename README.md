# AMLS-assignment
AMLS final assignment

# A brief introduction of the task.
The assignment required the training of classification models for an MRI brain tumor dataset. Task A required the training of a binary classifier to classify whether there was a tumor or not in the image. Task B required training a classifier to classify four classes determining whether a tumor was present and what kind of tumor it was.
# A brief description of the organization of the files.
The dataset will need to be downloaded from the following link and within this the test dataset will need to be placed inside this directory.
The directories Task A and Task B contain the files necessary to create and train the models for each respective task.
Additional files present include figures used in the report to evaluate the models trained and an initial data exploration file.
# The role of each file.
