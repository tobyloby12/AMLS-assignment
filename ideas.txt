Things to try:

Feature selection and dimensionality reduction -> clustering

Feature extractions
Using PCA and LDA on MRI images- https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1208/1208.2128.pdf
lecture on MRI - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfUz7NVOXDo
GLRLM - seems good for texture analysis
HOG - finding changes in image eg edges and ROI
shape extraction overview - https://www.researchgate.net/publication/40902683_A_Survey_of_Shape_Feature_Extraction_Techniques/link/576396b308ae9964a16babfd/download
